        My name is Omar Ansari. I work at the intersection of armed conflict,
        illicit markets, cyberspace, and data. I am currently focused on OSINT
        techniques, geocomputation, and tool development. I hold a Master of
        Public Policy from the University of Chicago and a degree in Political
        Science from the University of Texas at Dallas.

      <p>
        My research interests and experience have ranged from social network
        analysis of the Chinese real estate debt crisis, to conflict forecasting
        using machine learning, and tracking Chinese port acquisitions and
        facilities to assess American trade risk.
