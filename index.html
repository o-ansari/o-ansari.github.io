        My name is Omar Ansari. I work at the intersection of armed conflict, illicit markets, cyberspace, and data.
        Currently focused on OSINT techniques, geocomputation, and tool development. I have a Master in Public
        Policy from the University of Chicago, and a Political Science degree from the University of Texas at Dallas.
        My research interests and experience have ranged from social network analysis of the Chinese Real Estate Debt
        Crisis, Conflict Forecasting using Machine Learning, and tracking Chinese Port Acquisition and Facilities to
        forecast American Trade risk.
